# DockerTools
Tools For Docker, including Visual Studio Provisioning and Publishing

The contents of this repo are currently used to enable provisioning of Docker Container Hosts in Azure through the [Visual Studio Tools for Docker](http://aka.ms/DockerToolsForVs) 
The script included here is an internal part of the Visual Studio Tools for Docker, to fill a gap until we complete the Docker Extension for Windows. 

It is not intended to be used directly. The repo and it's content are  made public to enable the Docker Host to pull this script dynamically
